## Abstract

This project analyzes Tesla Inc.'s historical stock prices from June 29, 2010, to February 3, 2023, focusing on key financial indicators such as Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume. The aim is to identify patterns, trends, and fluctuations in Tesla's stock, exploring factors like price volatility, trading turnover, and investor sentiment. The insights will aid investors and analysts in forecasting Tesla's future stock movements and understanding the dynamics influencing its price.

## Introduction

Tesla Inc., a prominent player in the EV market, has seen significant growth and volatility in its stock price due to innovations, production records, and market trends. This project examines Tesla's stock data from June 29, 2010, to February 3, 2023, using financial indicators to identify trends and predict future stock price variations. The analysis will leverage statistical and financial modeling techniques to offer forecasts and insights into Tesla's stock performance.

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Address missing values and outliers using methods like IQR to ensure data quality.
- **Feature Normalization and Scaling**: Apply Min-Max Scaling and StandardScaler to normalize Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume data for better model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Utilize box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and pair plots to explore data trends and relationships.
- **Model Development and Evaluation**: Create and compare Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor models, evaluating them using MSE, R² Score, and MAE.
- **Model Selection and Optimization**: Identify the best-performing model and fine-tune it to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Ethical Considerations

The analysis will adhere to ethical research practices, using only open data and maintaining confidentiality. The research is conducted impartially, ensuring that results are unbiased and not influenced by individual investor data.
